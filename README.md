#### make a new folder for the codebase
make a new folder. In cmd, navigate to this directory and type in `git init`

#### Set this repository as the 'remote origin' 
type in this command in the command line `git remote add origin https://github.com/armdev-sanjay/TSAT5_COMMS.git`


#### 'Pull' the codebase from github to your local directory
`git pull origin master`

#### make a new branch
`git checkout -b new_branch_name`

#### make changes to the files

#### add and commit your changes


`git add .`
`git commit -m comment_on_changes_made`

#### push your code to github as a new branch
`git push origin new_branch_name`


### Now you should be able to see your changes on github!
